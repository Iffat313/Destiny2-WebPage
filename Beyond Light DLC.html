    <h1>What is the Beyond Light DLC?</h1>
    <p><strong>*The Beyond light DLC is the 5th DLC that was introduced into the destiny 2 video game. Of course, on our webpage, this is the first D2 DLC we've brought up. The
        enemies here surrond what's called STASIS. In fact, this DLC introduced three new subclasses revolving around this new element known as stasis: As a titan you would have
    the BEHEMOTH, as the hunter you would have the REVENANT, and as the warlock you would have the SHADEBINDER. </p></strong>
        <dl>
            <!--We use the i element here to give the italized look-->
            <h2><dt><i>* Raids and PVE:</i> </dt></h2>
            <dd> There is a new raid called: "Deep Stone Crypt". DSC does feature a harder difficulty mode and a easy mode. Both modes, have the guardians go through  multiple counters. The 
              first encounter is where you have to break six different security fuses. In this phase, you can have three buffs; <i>"operator,</i><i id = "p"> charged with light (from a titan sheild),
              </i> <i>  and scanner."</i> Make the best of this buffs, otherwise you will lose it and may not break the gate. The last fight is a intense boss fight. As usual, be prepared to talk with your team.

                <img src = "DSC_RAID.jpg" alt ="dsc raid" class = "borderforimage">
            </dd>
           <h2> <dt><i>* Crucible</i>:  </dt></h2>
            <dd> After doing some research, it seems that bungie has actually deleted crucible maps instead of creating new ones for the DLC. The reason for this may vary. Infact, I belive the action for this is 
              for making more storage in the game. It's clear that users were upset about this and wanted to know why. According to "Gamer Rant", it seems that there were at least 11 maps that were vaulted. I 
              think it's shame that this occured, however, after further thinking, I think this decision was implemented for future DLC's.

            </dd>
            <h2><dt><i>* Weapons and others</i>: </dt></h2>
            <dd>With the new DLC, there are new weapons we can use to play around with. One weapon is the <i  class = "red"><strong>Eyes Of Tommorow</i></strong>. Unlike the other DLC's
                we'e discussed, there is no quest here. In fact, to raise the stakes, we're talking about a very low chance of getting this weapon.
