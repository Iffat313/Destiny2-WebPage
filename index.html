 <!--the p tag is used for paragraphs-->

<h3>What's PVE? and PVP?</h3>

<p>You don't know what PVE or PVP is?! <em>PVE stands for player versus enemy where as PVP stands for player versus player</em>. Due to the many exapnsion passes, there are lot's of enemy's.
Some of these enemys are small or huge. They have a chance of dropping many weapons and armour for your liking! As for PVP, you can team up with your

<h1>How to power up your charcater: </h1>
<article>
<section>
<br>
<p>Powering up your character is important. Otherwise, you won't be able to keep up with other players or have any fun. While powering up your
   may seem broad, let's break it down!

<pre>

Here is a list of things you should know:

</pre>

<dl>
    <!--We use the strong element here to give it a bold look-->
    <!--We also use the span element to give it some css-->
    <dt><strong>* Understand Weapons</strong>: </dt>
    <dd><span id = "red">Assault, pulse, handcanaon, and other weapons have their specailities</span>. For PVP, many players choose what's best for their character.</dd>
    <dd>For instance, because hunters hide in the shawdow, they'll tend to use snipers. As for PVE, many players well use weapons that can generate orbs of light or a benefit to othe</dd>
    <dt><strong>* Armour</strong>:  </dt>
    <dd><span id = "green">Helmet, Chestplate, Legs, boots, charcater item, and artifact</span>. Armour with high stats rolls can allow additional perks in their slots</dd>
    <dd>These slots can give a buff to your weapons or to your double the stats on your armour!</dd>
    <dt><strong>* Stats</strong>: </dt>
    <dd><span id = "blue">Resillence, Recovery, discipline, and all other stats can differ based on your armour stats.</span></dd>
    <dd>Stats can change the playing feild allowing you take more damage or deal more damge</dd>
    <dd>The discipline stat allows you to throw more gernades!</dd>
</dl>
<!--used a descriptive list for both articles-->
</section>

<!--Second article and section-->
<br>
<article>
<section>
<h1>Choosing the right activities</h1>
<p>Choosing the right activities is important. This is what's going to allow you to power up your character even more. Make sure to pay 
    special attention to the examples for each point!</p>
    <dl>
        <!--We use the i element here to give the italized look-->
        <h2><dt><i>* Raids:</i> </dt></h2>
        <dd>We discussed raids brefily before. Raids all multiple activities. They have muliple boss fights and maze layers. Please note
            the boss fight's have certain time intervals to be defated in. For example, the final boss in, <q> Kings fall: Oryx
            </q> will only give you about, at most, less than 50 minutes. You should complete raid with the best weapons in your arsenal, 
            assign players where they're best experinced, and get the best loot. A entry level raid would probably be Scourage of the past,
            however this raid has been taken out. Therefore, try <q>lavithian.</q>
        </dd>
       <h2> <dt><i>* Crucible</i>:  </dt></h2>
        <dd>Crucible offers a select variety of game modes: team death match, free for all, trials of osiris, and more. To be clear 
            these game modes range from fun to competitve. Both game modes have the ability to give good loot. However, the competitive gamemodes
            have the ability to drop even better gear for your power level.
        </dd>
        <h2><dt><i>* Strikes and nightfalls</i>: </dt></h2>
        <dd>You can think of strikes as a basic co-op mission. Although, when it comes to nightfalls, it makes a strike look easy.<cite>
            According to Kaleb's article on Destiny 2: Nightfall Missions Guide (Everything You Need To Know - SCREENRAT),</cite>
            nightfall's are simialr to strikes, but they place much harder modifires on these missions. For example, one modifier causes 
            only one element in the game to be superior and other eneimes to give twice the damage.

    <P>
    1. On the right is a <strong>exotic engram</strong>. The exotic engram offer's exotic gear.
    Just to recall, we gave some examples earlier. Exotic engrams can be found 
    from harder diffucltuy level in the activties we mentioned in the first page.
    They can also be found from xur (the exotic vendor)
    </P>

    <img src="legendary2.webp" alt="legendary engram" width = "100" height = "100" id="last">
    <p>
    2. The <strong>legendary engram</strong> is still hard to find. Of course, it offer's legendary gear.
    This legendary engrams can be found at a more medium difficulty level for the activites
    we mentioned above. Note, that just because you found legendary gear, this doesn't mean
    that it will always give you a boost of power (this is a rule made to keep players playing)
    </p>

    <img src="raree.webp" alt="exotic engram" width = "100" height = "100" id="last">
    <P>
     3. The <strong>rare engram</strong> can be found almost every where. In fact, you may even find it in
     the much harder difficulty level activites we mentioned in the first part of this page. Of course, the rare 
     engrams offer rare gear. Rare engrams won't be of much help if you're at
     a high level.

<h3>Below is a 3D model of the following classes/characters in Destiny 2:</h3>
<section id = menu>
    <img src="Titan.png" alt="picture of tian character" width = "100" height = "100">
    <P>
    1. This is a <strong style = "color:lightblue">titan</strong>. The titan here is actually a side character within the destiny 1 and 2 franchise. 
    In fact, this character is so popular, that he has a helmet named after him. This helmet is called 
    "helm of saint-14."
    <button id = input>Give me the details of this character</button>
    </P>

    <img src="Warlock.png" alt="picture of warlock character" width = "100" height = "100">
    <p>
    2. This is a <strong style = "color:gold">warlock</strong>. The armour that the warlock is wearing here is very nice. Not only is it nice but
    hard to get. To be accurate, this is the trails of osiris armour. 
    <button id = input>Give me the details of this character</button>
    </p>

    <img src="Hunter.png" alt="picture of hunter character" width = "100" height = "100">
    <P>
     3. This is a <strong style = "color:#d1633c">hunter.</strong> The hunter is wearing a extoic helmet. The name of this helmet is known as the 
     "celestial nighthawk." As a reminder, this helmet is only useful when you have the solar subclass equipped. This is because the helmet allows 
     you to combine all your golden shots into, bursting into ultimate damage!!!
     <button id = input>Give me the details of this character</button>
